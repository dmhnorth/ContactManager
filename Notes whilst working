get PastMeetingList actually returns all the meetings at the moment
this is the same for future, so use the future meeting list to sort this out

meetSort could clean up a list and remove duplicates




use find bugs. 




IDGEN - mention this in the javadoc
current idGenerator goes into the production code along with the interface, including the static part
create my custom idGenerator for use in my testing package.

DataManager - Mention this in the javadoc


this has to be passed into the contact manager when it is instantiated, which during my tests, i use the special one.
THIS IS DEPENDANCY INJECTION. The class i care about is the class Iâ€™m testing.


clean up all the TODOs
Refactoring (first check all the the tests are working appropriately!!)
- check the way dates are compared, using compareto could be a more effective, less messy way of doing this. 
- create instances of each list or hash set on the fly throughout methods rather than at the top. may end up being cleaner throughout
