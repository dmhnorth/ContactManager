getPastMeetingList test needs to be fixed.

finish the getPastMeetingList method

use this method and test to implement getFutureMeetingList

within the tests I am most likely suffering from a race within the JVM. One suggested solution to this would be to set up the ID generator separately within each test. Or, set its individual value to 0 at the beginning and the end of each test. (beginning only would probably be fine)

use find bugs.
