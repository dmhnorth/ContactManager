the test for saving, I currently just wanted anything at all to be returned, even if the contacts don’t match.
The project is definitely saving them, its just not reading them out right





use find bugs.

this has to be passed into the contact manager when it is instantiated, which during my tests, i use the special one.
THIS IS DEPENDANCY INJECTION. The class i care about is the class I’m testing.


clean up all the TODOs
Refactoring (first check all the the tests are working appropriately!!)
- check the way dates are compared, using compareto could be a more effective, less messy way of doing this. 
- create instances of each list or hash set on the fly throughout methods rather than at the top. may end up being cleaner throughout
