getPastMeetingList test needs to be fixed.

finish the getPastMeetingList method

use this method and test to implement getFutureMeetingList

within the tests I am most likely suffering from a race within the JVM. One suggested solution to this would be to set up the ID generator separately within each test. Or, set its individual value to 0 at the beginning and the end of each test. (beginning only would probably be fine)

use find bugs. 





create an interface for the idGenerator, 

current idGenerator goes into the production code along with the interface, including the static part
create my custom idGenerator for use in my testing package.

this has to be passed into the contact manager when it is instantiated, which during my tests, i use the special one.
THIS IS DEPENDANCY INJECTION. The class i care about is the class Iâ€™m testing.
